<h2>My Skills</h2>
<p>
I have a strong foundation in HTML5, allowing me to structure web content effectively. I'm proficient in using headings (h1-h3) to create a clear hierarchy and paragraphs to present information in a readable format. 
I also utilize formatting elements like <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> to emphasize key points.

<p>My commitment to clean code ensures my projects are maintainable and scalable. © 2024</p>
